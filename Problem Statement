Problem Statement 

Design a Lightweight KYC App for Bharat

Context:

You are the Associate Product Manager at a tech startup building digital onboarding solutions. Your company is launching a mobile app targeting rural and semi-urban India, where smartphone specs are low-end, bandwidth is limited and users may not be digitally literate.

The app must support:

- Digilocker-based KYC
- Document-based KYC (Aadhaar, PAN, DL, VoterID)
- Face authentication (liveness, facematch checks)
- Integration with other client apps (SDK integration, web-redirection, etc.)
- Offline & retry-friendly mode

**Your Task**: Design the KYC solution end-to-end, keeping in mind the following:

1. Product Design & UX:

- How will the app work for users with low digital literacy?
- What will the user flow look like (screens, guidance, fail-safes)? Create wireframes.
- What offline/low-network support will you offer?

2. Features:

- Suggest and implement 2-3 innovative features to improve trust or ease of use using LLMs.
- How will you prioritise which features to build? Create a Prioritisation Matrix

3. Technical Architecture:

- How will you optimize SDK size?
- What trade-offs will you make between on-device vs server-side processing (e.g., facematch, liveness)?
- How will you handle low bandwidth and retry/resume flows?

4. Miscellaneous:

- How would you measure the success of the app?
- Any security concerns and how youâ€™ll solve them?

Feel free to use LLMs, and AI-tools such as Lovable to work on this assignment. However, please ensure the submission is completely original.

Final Deliverables:

1. Deck/PPT in .pdf format
2. A short video (not more than 5 mins) of you explaining the deck, your thought process to arrive at the problem statement, and how you arrived at the final solution.
    1. Ensure the deck is also visible along with you while presenting.
